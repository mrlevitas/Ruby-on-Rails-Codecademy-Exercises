This repo is an introduction to Rails applications. 

How to set them up and build web apps such as static pages, apps that use databases (or models as they are called in Rails),
and form relationships between models.

Basic programming & Ruby syntax knowledge assumed. 

Initially put together as notes for personal use, I thought it might be of benefit to others.

Enjoy!
